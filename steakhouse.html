                <p><b>Ambiance</b><br>
                The restaurant has a distinct upmarket, yet casual feel to it. Wijnhuis is spacious - quite a large high room with some various nooks and alcoves, well designed for seating. Being a large group, we were seated in a private dining room though – with direct access to a private patio. Works for some; others prefer the hustle and bustle of a busy steakhouse.
                    <br><br>
                <b>Food</b><br/>
                Dinner kicked off with plates of Bruschetta Prosciutto, Carpaccio and Calamari – all very good. Wijnhuis were thoughtful enough to compile and print our own bespoke steak menu - offering sirloin, fillet or sirloin-on-the-bone cuts. The 350gram fillet steak was priced at R308, which is notably expensive. However, just about everyone gave their steaks good scores.
                    <br><br>
                Expectedly, Wijnhuis has an extensive selection of wines – and the wine list contains around 500 wines including collectors and vintage wines. Diners can also enjoy 20 wines available by the glass/carafe.
                    <br><br>
                <b>Service</b><br>
                We had two dedicated waitrons to take care of us, and they did a fantastic job. Always on hand, but never in your face.</p>
